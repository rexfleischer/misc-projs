one of the largest parts of the game is managing what science is
being worked on. there is supposed to be a gigantic amount of science
that can be worked on, and its up to the user to manage the time 
spent on certain science and trying to specialize to get an edge.
the science will be split into different layer:
* theoretical: this will take the longest amount of time to get, but
is basically the gate into different branches of science. they have 
to do with the highest level of science and, once discovered, there
must be spent a lot of time and resources fully unlocking it. the user
will start with a good amount of these unlocked, and will have a good
amount of these ready for starting to fully unlock... but part of the
excitement of the game is supposed to be the surprises of what type 
of theoretical science can be developed, meaning that there will be
much of the science only available through discoveries. a few examples
of these highest level sciences are:
*** robotics military
*** clone military
*** cyborge military
*** mutant military
*** different types of weapons
*** different types of armors (once laser weapons are discovered, then the sub
                               sciences for that are available)
*** different types of thrusters
*** things for living spaces and social engineering
*** advanced forms of travel
*** special weapons tactics like clocking
*** deflective shields
*** absorbing shields
* these are the sub layers of science, or branches. here, the science is
dependent on one another and can only be worked on one at a time (assuming
the user has enough science points and gives enough time). this is the 
simpler more intuitive part of the science because it will be more contained
what is actually happening. for instance, a node within the laser weapon 
brach would look like this:

science.weapon.laser.light.soldier_loading_training_1 = [
