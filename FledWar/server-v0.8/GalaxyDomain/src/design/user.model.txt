this model will describe the data model for the user. the user data 
model will include all of the resources, populations, plans, production
trade routes, military, foreign policies... everything that has to
do with the user. while putting together the data model, its important 
to take a few things into account:
* not all information is available to the user. a user can only see
things close to what they have control over... unless they have some
sort of agreement with other users.
* the user can only give commands to things they own... but the commands
that are being executed must be expressible within this data model. just 
like how the ${galaxy.model} expresses how to change and move the different
objects, this data model must express the same.
* there are limits to the things that we are putting together... for instance,
a factory will have a throughput limit, but that limit cannot be met if 
materials cannot get to it or the people can work there. also, if there is no
place for materials to go (wearhouses can fill up or factories could not 
handle all the material given), then the pipeline before the factory will
max out and have to wait on the factory.
* much of the changes will have to be some type of transaction, meaning,
to ensure that users cant do something that will put thing in the negative
somewhere, there has to be validation ran on every action the user wishes 
to perform.
